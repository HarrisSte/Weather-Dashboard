# WEATHER DASHBOARD

# Description

Using the OpenWeather API, users can search for a city of their choice and be presented with the current weather situation as well as a five-day forecast. The information provided includes the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each. The current day will be displayed separately from the five-day forecast, with the forecast indicating the dates for each day.

If a user wishes to revisit a previously searched city, all they need to do is click on the city name on the left side of the application under 'search history'. All previous user searches are stored locally in the web browser.

# Contribtions
For this application, I utilized multiple resources to help me develop this application. I worked with my tutor, Ben Martin, to help solve an issue I faced. I also attended office hours and spoke directly to my instructor. In addition, I combed through the numerous resources provided by my instructor and TAs in the boot camp. I referenced outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, Medium, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with my classmates.
