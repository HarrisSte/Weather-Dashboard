# WEATHER DASHBOARD

# Description
Using OpenWeather API, users can search for a city of their choice and be presented with current weather situation as well as a five-day forecast. The information rendered for each is the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The current day will be separate from the five day forecast; with the forecast containing the dates for each day.

If a user wished to go back to previously searched city, all they will need to do is click on the name of the city on the left of the application under 'search histroy'. All previous user searched are stored locally on the web browser.

# Contribtions
For this application, I utilized multiple resources to help me develop this application. I worked with my tutor, Ben Martin, to help solve an issue I faced. I also attended office hours and spoke directly to my instructor. In addition, I combed through the numerous resources provided by my instructor and TAs in the boot camp. I referenced outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, Medium, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with my classmates.
