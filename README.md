For this application, I utilized multiple resources to help me develop this application. I worked with my tutor, Ben Martin, to help solve an issue I faced. I also attended office hours and spoke directly to my instructor. In addition, I combed through the numerous resources provided by my instructor and TAs in the boot camp. I referenced outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, Medium, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with my classmates.
